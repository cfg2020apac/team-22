JA Finance for Future goes beyond basic personal financial management. It aims to links today’s responsible choices with our shared sustainable future, by providing students with experiential learning on financial literacy that aligns with the Core Competencies Framework on Financial Literacy for Youth developed by the OECD International Network on Financial Education (INFE).
